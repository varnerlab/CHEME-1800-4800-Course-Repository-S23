# Principles of Computational Thinking for Engineers

## Description
Engineering practice increasingly relies on computational tools and data analysis approaches. This one-semester course introduces computational thinking into engineering analysis. We integrate data science and statistics, artificial intelligence, and mathematical modeling approaches into the context of contemporary problems in the design and analysis of processes, products, and systems. The course is agnostic to platforms and tools; we’ll focus on paradigms, not syntax. However, we’ll use the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org) and its associated toolchain when transitioning from idea to implementation. Course assignments use data sets and examples to develop fluency and understanding of real-life problems. In addition, we’ll use cloud computing resources for course materials, assignments, and projects. Weekly labs provide guided practice on the computer, with teaching staff present. 

### Time, place and website
* __Credits__: 4-credits
* __Lectures and discussions__: Lecture at TuTh 9:05 AM - 9:55 AM and Discussion at TuTh 1:30 PM - 2:20 PM in Olin 245
* __Website__: Canvas and GitHub. Examples, labs, and other codes used throughout the course are available on our GitHub repository: [https://github.com/varnerlab/CHEME-1800-4800-Course-Repository-S23.git](https://github.com/varnerlab/CHEME-1800-4800-Course-Repository-S23.git).

### Outcomes
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
* Analyze process and product data sets using tools from data science/statistics, and machine learning (ML)
* Identify and test quantitative models of process and product performance using real-time dynamic and static data sets 
* Demonstrate mastery of quantitative decision-making and risk management approaches in the context of a process, product, or system design

### Topics
Lectures are organized into units, each having roughly four weeks of class time
* [Unit 1: Technical computing basics](https://varnerlab.github.io/CHEME-1800-Computing-Book/unit-1-basics/basics-landing.html)
* [Unit 2: Data, Algorithms, and Linear Algebra](https://varnerlab.github.io/CHEME-1800-Computing-Book/unit-2-data/data-landing.html)
* [Unit 3: The Learning Problem: Models, Learning, and Optimization](https://varnerlab.github.io/CHEME-1800-Computing-Book/unit-3-learning/learning-landing.html)
* [Unit 4: The Decision Problem: Probability, Random Process, and Decisions](https://varnerlab.github.io/CHEME-1800-Computing-Book/unit-4-decisions/decisions-landing.html)

## Grading
We expect this course to draw from a spectrum of students, including “those less comfortable with computing,” “those more comfortable with computing,” and those in between. However, what ultimately matters is not where you end up relative to your classmates but where you are relative to yourself. 

Each student’s final grade is individually determined at the end of the semester based on their peformance in the following components (percentages subject to change):

| Percentage | Component |
| ----------: | --------- |
| 10%	| __Participation__. Course participation (code reviews, questions and TA/course evaluations) will be an important component of the course. Participation opportunities will be identified throughout the semester. |
| 40%	| __Problem sets__. Approximately 10 problem sets will be administered over the semester. Problem sets will be distributed via Canvas (typically delivered on Friday afternoons and due one-week later). Problem sets can be completed in teams. |
| 20%	| __Mid-term exam__. One take-home, mid-term examination will be distributed. The distribution date will be announced ahead of time, and once distributed, students will have a specified number of hours (at least 36 hours) to complete the exam. |
| 30%	| __Final project__. Development of a research project by each student (semester long with additional emphasis during the final 5 weeks of the course). The projects will conclude with a written report and an oral presentation to the class near the end of the semester. The final written reports will be due on the University assigned date for final projects. |
